Write a function that finds the index of the first non-consecutive element in the array. 
For example, if we have an array [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7] then this will return 3 since the array
at index 3 is 5 which is not consecutive. If every element in the array is consecutive, return -1
*/

function firstNonConsecutive(arr){
   var arr = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]; //need [3]
   var lst = [];
   for (let i = 0;  i++) in array://set to 0, looking for i +1
       if (i not i+1 )
        return arr[i]
    return [-1];    
}
console.log(firstNonConsecutive(arr));


Write an arrow function 
return the sum of positives 

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.



let afun = (arr) =>  var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++ => if %2 == 0
       var arr = [1, 2, -7];
        
        
    console.log(arr[i])

    return afun
